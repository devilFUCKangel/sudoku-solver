## Hui Ming is my roommate and he is the one started this project.
### His idea is brute force find the solution
- start with fill all number (all start with 1) and verify it
- if answer incorrect then revert/change the number start from the last position
- the revert keep go up until found an answer.

# SudokuSolver
## SudokuSolver is the first version which I develop in year 2017.
### This sudoku solver brute force with advance algorithm (but more code line), and the step is complex and not clear
- start with mark the all the position with possible number
- then fill the position if it is contain only 1 possible number
- fill all the possible number until there is no any left or left all position with 2 possible number and above.
- start brute force with the possible number left until found correct answer

# SudokuSolver 2018
## SudokuSolver 2018 is the second version which I develop in year 2018.
### The concept almost same with the first version but with more organized code
